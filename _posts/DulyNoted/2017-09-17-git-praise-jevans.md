Julia Evans, in her [recent summary of her time at the Recurse Center](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/17/how-i-spent-my-time-at-the-recurse-center/), links to [this cool little project](https://visualize-your-git.herokuapp.com/) which visualizes how you use Git.  Here’s my result:

I just got a new computer recently, and haven’t worked much on group projects, so it’s missing all the merging and rebasing and tagging I usually do.  But it’s still pretty neat!  You can see the “status -> add -> commit” pipeline very clearly.

Thanks, Julia!
