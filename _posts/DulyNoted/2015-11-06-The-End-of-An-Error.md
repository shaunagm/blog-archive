I missed this paper when it went around last week: [The prevalence of statistical reporting errors in psychology (1985–2013)](http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-015-0664-2/fulltext.html).  Daniel Lakens has [a very good review](http://daniellakens.blogspot.nl/2015/10/checking-your-stats-and-some-errors-we.html) of it.

At the center of the paper is the new R-package statcheck.  It is a pleasure to see all the new tools being developed to aid in scientific research.   

And, not to be snarky, but R needs it.  I’ve talked before about an entirely unrelated [source of errors](https://gist.github.com/shaunagm/dc9428726287664990f2) in R.  I‘m feeling a bit inspired by the Nuijeten et al paper - perhaps I’ll set aside some time this month to actually go through some published analyses and see if they contain any silent recycling errors.
