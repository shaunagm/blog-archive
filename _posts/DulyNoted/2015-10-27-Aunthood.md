It’s hard to trick my niece - she wasn’t born yesterday, you know! 

In fact, she was born 2.5 days ago, and it’s hard to trick her because it’s hard to do anything with her other than feed her, change her, and hold her til your arms collapse trembling with exhaustion and love.

Due to said trembling, this Iron Blogger post will be dismissed early.

Have a photo:
