Hi, I'm Shauna. I have a terrible habit of starting blogs, newsletters, etc and then dropping them after a year or so.

I'm creating this blog archive to keep a copy of all my posts, going back as far as I can find them. It may duplicate stuff that's still online, but that's better than the alternative!
